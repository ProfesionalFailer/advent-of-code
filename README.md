This year, I decided to solve the the challenges using **C** since I'm currently learning it at university, and this provides an excellent opportunity to practice my skill using such a low-level language. As a result, my solutions this year tries to achieve solutions using every little trick I learnt, hoping this will help me improving my skills.

If you're interested in how I approach problem-solving in C, feel free to check out my solutions!
